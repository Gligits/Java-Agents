# creating the environment 

## Note : 
This agent environment can be set up using either JADE (for Java) or SAPDE (for Python). The instructions here will focus on setting up JADE for Java, as this repository will contain the Java version.

1. Download and Install Eclipse
Start by downloading Eclipse if you haven't already. 
Itâ€™s an integrated development environment (IDE) widely used for Java development.
2. Setting Up JADE
Download JADE ( you can find it as a zip file on this repository )
Extract the jade folder from it to a preferred location on your computer.
3. Configure JADE in Eclipse
Open Eclipse and create a new Java project.
Right-click on the project, go to Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries, and click Add External JARs.
Add the jade.jar file (found in the lib folder of the extracted JADE files).

**ps: For typical JADE usage removing _module-info.java_ is recommended and will make the development process more straightforward.**

4. Now create a new class on the src folder. You can put a name on the package (it will be created automatically) or leave it as the default one.

**Small thing if you can't use the default package then you gotta go to Properties again, then Java Build Path, and be sure that you checked the name of your project on Source**

Perfect! Now you should be ready to start writing code!!
