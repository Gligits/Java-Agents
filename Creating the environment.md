# creating the environment 

## Note : 
This agent environment can be set up using either JADE (for Java) or SAPDE (for Python). The instructions here will focus on setting up JADE for Java, as this repository will contain the Java version.

1. Download and Install Eclipse
Start by downloading Eclipse if you haven't already. Itâ€™s an integrated development environment (IDE) widely used for Java development.
2. Setting Up JADE
Download JADE from the JADE download page.
Extract the downloaded files to a preferred location on your computer.
3. Configure JADE in Eclipse
Open Eclipse and create a new Java project.
Right-click on the project, go to Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries, and click Add External JARs.
Add the jade.jar file (found in the lib folder of the extracted JADE files).
