# JADE (Java Agent Development Framework)
JADE is a framework for developing multi-agent systems in Java. It simplifies the implementation of agents that can communicate and cooperate to perform tasks. Each agent runs as an independent thread and can perform specific behaviors.
## Agents
Communicate with other agents.
Make decisions based on its goals and environment.
Perform actions based on behaviors.

Agents are created by extending the Agent class in JADE and overriding the `setup()` method. 
The `setup()` method is where you initialize the agent and define its behaviors.

    import jade.core.Agent;

    public class MyAgent extends Agent {
    protected void setup() {
        System.out.println("Hello, I am " + getLocalName());
    }
    }
Note that to run this, you'll need to introduce the arguments through the RUN CONFIGURATIONS as shown here :

**-flag nameOrIdentifierOfTheAgent:classname**
In this case you can use : **-gui GLIGITS:YOURCLASSNAME**

## Behaviors

Behaviors in JADE define the actions an agent can perform. 
There are different types of behaviors you can use, depending on the task:

- SimpleBehavior: Basic behavior executed once. It involves overriding the action() and done() methods.
- CyclicBehavior: Repeats indefinitely (useful for ongoing tasks).
- OneShotBehavior: Executes its action() method only once and then finishes.
- SequentialBehavior: Allows you to add multiple behaviors that execute one after another.
- ParallelBehavior: Executes multiple behaviors concurrently.

### Creating a Behavior (This is an expample of a simple behaviour )
To create a behavior, you extend one of the behavior classes (Behaviour, CyclicBehaviour, etc.) and override the action() and done() methods

    import jade.core.behaviours.Behaviour;

    public class MyBehavior extends Behaviour {
    int step = 0;
    @override
    public void action() {
        switch (step) {
            case 0:
                System.out.println("Performing step 0");
                step++;
                break;
            case 1:
                System.out.println("Performing step 1");
                step++;
                break;
            case 2:
                System.out.println("Performing step 2");
                step++;
                break;
        }
    }
    @override
    public boolean done() {
        return step == 3;
    }
    }
#### Adding Behaviors to an Agent
  Behaviors are added to an agent using the addBehaviour() method in the setup() method
  
    import jade.core.Agent;

    public class MyAgent extends Agent {
    protected void setup() {
        System.out.println("Hello, I am " + getLocalName());
        addBehaviour(new MyBehavior()); // Adding a behavior to the agent
    }
    }

Note : while doing an execution like this : 

    import jade.core.Agent;

    public class Agent2 extends Agent {
	
	public void setup(){
			System.out.println("Hello world my name is " + getLocalName()); addBehaviour(new B1());
			}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String [] jadeArg = new String [2];
		StringBuffer SbAgent = new StringBuffer();
		SbAgent.append("S1:Agent2;");
		SbAgent.append("S2:Agent2;");
		SbAgent.append("S3:Agent2;");


		jadeArg[0]="-gui";
		jadeArg[1]=SbAgent.toString();
		jade.Boot.main(jadeArg);
		}
    }

An inversion might occur due to the way the JADE platform processes and schedules agents. When you launch multiple agents in JADE, the execution order isn't strictly guaranteed to follow the order in which the agents are listed. JADE manages agents as separate threads, and the operating system schedules these threads for execution, leading to potential variations in the order of output.
Another thing that you might have noticed is that this execution contains the arguments here 

    jadeArg[0]="-gui";
    jadeArg[1]=SbAgent.toString();
    jade.Boot.main(jadeArg);

This means you won't need to introduce them when you want to run it, so you can directly click on RUN!

## ACL ( agent communication language )

### what is an acl ? 
In JADE, ACL (Agent Communication Language) is used for communication between agents. It allows agents to send messages to each other in a standardized format
### when to use ACL ?
The necessity of using Agent Communication Language (ACL) in JADE depends on the behavior of the agents. If a behavior performs computations or tasks that do not involve communication with other agents, such as local data processing, then ACL is not needed. However, if the behavior requires sending or receiving messages to or from other agents, such as sharing data or coordinating actions, then ACL is essential to ensure structured and effective communication.

### Components of ACL

**Performative:** This defines the type of message and the intention behind it. Examples include:
INFORM: The sender is informing the receiver of some fact.
REQUEST: The sender is requesting that the receiver perform some action.
AGREE, REFUSE, CONFIRM, DISCONFIRM, etc., for various stages of communication.

**Sender and Receiver(s):**
Sender: The agent sending the message.
Receiver(s): One or more agents that will receive the message.

**Content**: The data or information being sent. It could be a simple string, serialized object, or any other data format.

**Conversation ID and Language/Ontology (Optional):**
These are used to manage complex conversations and specify the context in which the communication is happening.

### When and Where to Use ACL in an Agent's Lifecycle

**Setup Phase:** When initializing the agent, you may send a greeting or status message to other agents or request some information.

**Behavior Execution:** During the agent's execution, you may need to send messages to request data, share results, or coordinate actions with other agents.

**Cleanup or Shutdown Phase:** You can inform other agents that you're shutting down or that a task is complete.

### Example Situations to Call ACL Methods

**To Inform Other Agents of a State Change:**
Use ACLMessage.INFORM when an agent completes a task and wants to notify others.

**To Request Data or an Action:**
Use ACLMessage.REQUEST if you need another agent to perform some operation or provide information.

**To Wait for Responses:**
Use blockingReceive() if you expect a reply and want to wait for it. Use receive() for a non-blocking check.

**PS: You can find an example of an Agent-Based Sum Calculation project that showcases how agents communicate and collaborate using JADE in my repository. The agents use ACL messages for communication. Agent1 initiates the process by sending the array to both Agent2 and Agent3. After performing their calculations, Agent2 and Agent3 send their results back to Agent1, which then collects and displays the sums**


# Important Note : 
By default JADE always uses the same port for communication. When a platform is already listening on that port, attempting to start another instance will cause a conflict and result in errors. To avoid this, make sure to exit the platform before trying to run another one.
If you closed the platform without properly exiting, you can resolve the issue by following these steps:
Open your terminal (as an administrator) and type:

    netstat -ano | findstr :1099
This will list the PID of the process currently listening on port 1099
   
    kill PID
Replace <PID> with the actual process ID listed. This will terminate the process that is occupying the port .
